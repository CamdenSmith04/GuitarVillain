This application is a work in progress, which will eventually have the functionality of a guitar and bass music app. It will contain the following features:

## Instrument-Teaching Modules
Pre-made modules containing lessons and practice songs will be readily available to cement the fundamentals of the user's chosen instrument.

## Hosting and joining music courses
Users can choose to participate in a classroom model of learning, where a teacher may create courses with their chosen students, assign lessons and songs to students, and return graded feedback of the assignments.

## Song-Writing Interface
Users will compose their own music given the in-app song writing function.

## Social functioning
Users can interact with each other by viewing profiles, adding people as friends, and viewing other users' published songs.

## And Much More!
Stay tuned to see all the new exciting features of Guitar Villain!
